# 🔧 Quick Fix: Backend Not Connecting to Frontend

## ⚡ Most Common Issues (Check These First!)

### 1. **CORS Configuration - Most Important!**

**In Railway → Variables tab:**
- Check `FRONTEND_URL` exists
- Must be: `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app` (exact match, no trailing slash)
- After updating, Railway will auto-redeploy

**Example:**
```
✅ Correct: https://futurescope-website.vercel.app
❌ Wrong: https://futurescope-website.vercel.app/
❌ Wrong: http://futurescope-website.vercel.app
```

### 2. **Frontend API URL**

**In Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables:**
- Check `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Must be: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app` (no trailing slash)
- After updating, go to Deployments → Redeploy

**Example:**
```
✅ Correct: https://your-app.railway.app
❌ Wrong: https://your-app.railway.app/
```

### 3. **Test Your Backend**

1. **Get your Railway URL:**
   - Railway → Settings → Domains → Copy your domain

2. **Test in browser:**
   - Open: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/v1/job/get`
   - Should see JSON response (even if empty array)
   - If you see 404 or error, backend isn't working

3. **Check Railway Logs:**
   - Railway → Deployments → Click latest → View logs
   - Should see: "Server running at port 8000"
   - Should see: "MongoDB connected successfully"
